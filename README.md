# [ngx-vh-style](https://github.com/sergiocarneiro/ngx-vh-style)

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/ngx-vh-style.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngx-vh-style)

*ngx-vh-style* is an angular directive that allows to apply viewport height (VH) values in pixels, assuring maximum browser compatibility.



# Purpose

Viewport height is usually referred to as the window's inner height in %.

However, browsers such as Chrome Mobile make their toolbar height count towards the viewport height, making the inner height inaccessible through CSS if the element is not relatively parented to the body â€” which can easily happen when using component-driven frameworks like [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com).



# Setup

Install via npm:
```
npm install --save-exact ngx-vh-style
```

Include the module in the imports list of your app's module:
```js
import { VhStyleModule } from 'ngx-vh-style';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    VhStyleModule
  ]
})
```



# Usage
Simply write the CSS styles as you would normally do with the style attribute.

```html
<div vhStyle="max-height: 100vh"></div>
```



# Features

## Multi-property

```html
<div vhStyle="min-height: 50vh; max-height: 100vh"></div>
```

## Multi-value

```html
<div vhStyle="background-size: 50vh 50vh"></div>
```

## Non-vh values

```html
<div vhStyle="background-size: 500px 50vh"></div>
```
